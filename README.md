## What is Polykey?

**Polykey is an open-source, peer-to-peer system** that addresses the critical challenge in cybersecurity: **the secure sharing and delegation of authority**, in the form of secrets like keys, tokens, certificates, and passwords.

It allows users including developers, organizations, and machinesâ€”to **store these secrets in encrypted vaults on their own devices, and share them directly with trusted parties.**

* **All data is end-to-end encrypted**, both in transit and at rest, eliminating the risk associated with third-party storage.
* **Polykey provides a command line interface**, desktop and mobile GUI, and a web-based control plane for organizational management.
* By treating secrets as tokenized authority, it offers a fresh approach to **managing and delegating authority in zero-trust architectures** without adding burdensome policy complexity - a pervasive issue in existing zero-trust systems.
* Unlike complex self-hosted secrets management systems that require specialized skills and infrastructure, Polykey is **installed and running directly from the end-user device**.
* It is built to **automatically navigate network complexities** like NAT traversal, connecting securely to other nodes without manual configuration.

**Key features:**

* **Decentralized Encrypted Storage** - No storage of secrets on third parties, secrets are stored on your device and synchronised point-to-point between Polykey nodes.
* **Secure Peer-to-Peer Communication** - Polykey bootstraps TLS keys by federating trusted social identities (e.g. GitHub).
* **Secure Computational Workflows** - Share static secrets (passwords, keys, tokens and certificates) with people, between teams, and across machine infrastructure. Create dynamic (short-lived) smart-tokens with embedded policy for more sophisticated zero-trust authority verification.
* With Polykey Enterprise, you can create private networks of Polykey nodes and apply mandatory policy governing node behaviour.

## Installation

Note that JavaScript libraries are not packaged in Nix. Only JavaScript applications are.

Building the package:

```sh
nix build
```

### Nix

```sh
nix build
nix build '.#executable'
nix build '.#docker'
nix build '.#packages.x86_64-linux.executable'
nix build '.#packages.x86_64-windows.executable'
nix build '.#packages.x86_64-darwin.executable'
```

Install into Nix user profile:

```sh
nix profile install github:MatrixAI/Polykey-CLI
```

The program can be run directly without installing via `nix run`

```sh
nix run . -- agent start
```

### Docker

Install into Docker:

```sh
nix build '.#docker'
image="$(docker load < result | cut -d' ' -f3)"
docker run -it "$image"
```

## Development

Run `nix develop`, and once you're inside, you can use:

```sh
# install (or reinstall packages from package.json)
npm install
# build the dist
npm run build
# run the repl (this allows you to import from ./src)
npm run ts-node
# run the tests
npm run test
# lint the source code
npm run lint
# automatically fix the source
npm run lintfix
```

### Calling Commands

When calling commands in development, use this style:

```sh
npm run polykey -- p1 p2 p3
```

The `--` is necessary to make `npm` understand that the parameters are for your own executable, and not parameters to `npm`.

### Docs Generation

```sh
npm run docs
```

See the docs at: https://matrixai.github.io/Polykey-CLI/

### Publishing

```sh
# npm login
npm version patch # major/minor/patch
npm run build
npm publish --access public
git push
git push --tags
```
