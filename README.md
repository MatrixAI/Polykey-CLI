Polykey is an open-source, peer-to-peer system that addresses the critical challenge in cybersecurity: the secure sharing and delegation of authority, in the form of secrets like keys, tokens, certificates, and passwords.

It allows users including developers, organizations, and machinesâ€”to store these secrets in encrypted vaults on their own devices, and share them directly with trusted parties.

All data is end-to-end encrypted, both in transit and at rest, eliminating the risk associated with third-party storage.

Polykey provides a command line interface, desktop and mobile GUI, and a web-based control plane for organizational management.

By treating secrets as tokenized authority, it offers a fresh approach to managing and delegating authority in zero-trust architectures without adding burdensome policy complexity - a pervasive issue in existing zero-trust systems.

Unlike complex self-hosted secrets management systems that require specialized skills and infrastructure, Polykey is installed and running directly from the end-user device.

It is built to automatically navigate network complexities like NAT traversal, connecting securely to other nodes without manual configuration.

Key features:

* Decentralized Encrypted Storage - No storage of secrets on third parties, secrets are stored on your device and synchronised point-to-point between Polykey nodes.
* Secure Peer-to-Peer Communication - Polykey bootstraps TLS keys by federating trusted social identities (e.g. GitHub).
* Secure Computational Workflows - Share static secrets (passwords, keys, tokens and certificates) with people, between teams, and across machine infrastructure. Create dynamic (short-lived) smart-tokens with embedded policy for more sophisticated zero-trust authority verification.
* With Polykey Enterprise, you can create private networks of Polykey nodes and apply mandatory policy governing node behaviour.

## Installation

Note that JavaScript libraries are not packaged in Nix. Only JavaScript applications are.

Building the package:

```sh
npmDepsHash="$(prefetch-npm-deps ./package-lock.json)"
nix-build -E "(import ./pkgs.nix {}).callPackage ./default.nix { npmDepsHash = \"$npmDepsHash\"; }"
```

### Nix/NixOS

Building the releases:

```sh
nix-build ./release.nix --attr application --argstr npmDepsHash "$(prefetch-npm-deps ./package-lock.json)"
nix-build ./release.nix --attr docker --argstr npmDepsHash "$(prefetch-npm-deps ./package-lock.json)"
nix-build ./release.nix --attr package.linux.x64.elf --argstr npmDepsHash "$(prefetch-npm-deps ./package-lock.json)"
nix-build ./release.nix --attr package.windows.x64.exe --argstr npmDepsHash "$(prefetch-npm-deps ./package-lock.json)"
nix-build ./release.nix --attr package.macos.x64.macho --argstr npmDepsHash "$(prefetch-npm-deps ./package-lock.json)"
```

Install into Nix user profile:

```sh
nix-env -f ./release.nix --install --attr application --argstr npmDepsHash "$(prefetch-npm-deps ./package-lock.json)"
```

### Docker

Install into Docker:

```sh
loaded="$(docker load --input "$(nix-build ./release.nix --attr docker)")"
image="$(cut -d' ' -f3 <<< "$loaded")"
docker run -it "$image"
```

## Development

Run `nix-shell`, and once you're inside, you can use:

```sh
# install (or reinstall packages from package.json)
npm install
# build the dist
npm run build
# run the repl (this allows you to import from ./src)
npm run ts-node
# run the tests
npm run test
# lint the source code
npm run lint
# automatically fix the source
npm run lintfix
```

### Calling Commands

When calling commands in development, use this style:

```sh
npm run polykey -- p1 p2 p3
```

The `--` is necessary to make `npm` understand that the parameters are for your own executable, and not parameters to `npm`.

### Docs Generation

```sh
npm run docs
```

See the docs at: https://matrixai.github.io/TypeScript-Demo-Lib/

### Publishing

```sh
# npm login
npm version patch # major/minor/patch
npm run build
npm publish --access public
git push
git push --tags
```

## Deployment

Image deployments are done automatically through the CI/CD. However manual scripts are available below for deployment.

### Deploying to AWS ECR:

#### Using skopeo

```sh
tag='manual'
registry_image='015248367786.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/polykey'

# Authenticates skopeo
aws ecr get-login-password \
  | skopeo login \
  --username AWS \
  --password-stdin \
  "$registry_image"

build="$(nix-build ./release.nix --attr docker)"
# This will push both the default image tag and the latest tag
./scripts/deploy-image.sh "$build" "$tag" "$registry_image"
```

#### Using docker

```sh
tag='manual'
registry_image='015248367786.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/polykey'

aws ecr get-login-password \
  | docker login \
  --username AWS \
  --password-stdin \
  "$registry_image"

build="$(nix-build ./release.nix --attr docker)"
loaded="$(docker load --input "$build")"
image_name="$(cut -d':' -f2 <<< "$loaded" | tr -d ' ')"
default_tag="$(cut -d':' -f3 <<< "$loaded")"

docker tag "${image_name}:${default_tag}" "${registry_image}:${default_tag}"
docker tag "${image_name}:${default_tag}" "${registry_image}:${tag}"
docker tag "${image_name}:${default_tag}" "${registry_image}:latest"

docker push "${registry_image}:${default_tag}"
docker push "${registry_image}:${tag}"
docker push "${registry_image}:latest"
```
